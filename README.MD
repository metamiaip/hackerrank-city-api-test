Description:
This exercise is trying to redo the hackerrank city api test I was taken and tried to make it work now

I also try to write down different ways to write async/await with/without arrow function .
(useAyncCallAPI, useAyncArrow, getRelevantFoodOutlets)

How to run:
1. npm install (need axios and underscore)
2. node hackerrank-city-api-test.js (it will run getRelevantFoodOutlets)
    Note: the hackerrank api only has limited amount of data return, you can call in any browser:
    - http://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/food_outlets?city=Seattle&page=1
